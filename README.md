- 👋 Hi, I’m @quiquebh
- 👀 I’m interested in image processing and daily-tasks automation in Python. I also enjoy information visualization and document editorial
(like RISE for Jupyter Lab, Bookdown in R and so on).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning image processing for my Masters' thesis.
- 💞️ Currently I'm busy and not quite available for collabs, but as soon as I have time and energy for it I will update this.
- 📫 How to reach me: will update when available!
